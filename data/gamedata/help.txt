MODEM PLAY STARTUP HELP
.006
THE REQUEST IS TO PLAY THE GAME
OVER THE MODEM. THE FIRST THING
TO CONSIDER IS THE TYPE OF
CONNECTION, WHETHER YOU'RE THE HOST
OR THE SLAVE. THE HOST COMPUTER IS
THE COMPUTER THAT DIALS OUT, WHILE
THE SLAVE COMPUTER SETS THE AUTO
ANSWER ON THE MODEM AND WAITS FOR
THE CALL.

.009
KEYS TO PROPER CONNECTION

.006
THE FIRST KEY IS TO DECIDE
BEFORE OVER THE PHONE WHO IS
THE HOST AND WHO IS THE SLAVE.
IF YOU BOTH TRY TO DIAL OUT OR
BOTH TRY TO ANSWER IT WILL NOT
WORK. THE SECOND KEY IS TO
PLAYER NAME, SET THE COUNTRY,
GAME LEVEL, ASTRONAUT LEVEL,
GAME MODEL, AND ROSTER TYPE
BEFORE SELECTING DIAL NUMBER OR
AUTO ANSWER. THE LAST AND MOST
IMPORTANT KEY IS TO MAKE SURE YOU
HAVE THE PROPER BAUD RATE, COM
PORT, AND PARITY SET.  THE COM
PORT IS SPECIFIC TO YOUR
COMPUTER, BUT MAKE SURE THE BAUD
RATE AND PARITY ARE THE SAME AS
YOUR OPPONENT.
 
.009
DIAL NUMBER (HOST COMPUTER)

.006
ENTER THE PHONE NUMBER AS IF YOU'RE
DIALING A REGULAR NUMBER, INCLUDING
USING A ONE IN FRONT IF IT IS LONG
DISTANCE AND USING THE PROPER AREA
CODE. PRESSS ENTER TO SEND THE CALL.

.009
AUTO ANSWER (SLAVE COMPUTER)

.006
THE AUTO ANSWER BUTTON SETS THE
MODEM TO ANSWER THE PHONE WHEN
IT RINGS AND CONNECT THE MODEMS.
YOU CAN EITHER WAIT FOR THE
PHONE TO START RINGING AND THEN
PRESS AUTO ANSWER OR SIMPLY
PRESS THE BUTTON AND WAIT FOR
THE CALL. THE MODEM WILL WAIT
IN A LOOP UNTIL EITHER CANCEL
IS PRESSED OR THE PHONE RINGS.

.009
SELECTION PROBLEM

.006
NOTE IF FOR SOME REASON THE
PLAYERS SELECT THE SAME COUNTRY
THE HOST COMPUTER WILL KEEP ITS
SELECTION WHILE THE SLAVE
COMPUTER WILL DEFAULT TO THE
OPPOSITE COUNTRY.  IN THE CASE
THAT THIS HAPPENS THE GAME LEVEL
AND ASTRONAUT WILL FOLLOW THE
COUNTRY SELECTION. THE SAME RULE
APPLIES TO THE GAME MODEL AND
ROSTERS.
